        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! I'm a student learning how to build websites with Blazor. Blazor is a cool new way to make websites using C# instead of JavaScript. This website is my project to practice and show what I've learned.
        </p>

        <h2>What's Blazor?</h2>
        <p>
            Blazor is a framework from Microsoft. It's special because it lets you write your web apps using C#. Here are some reasons why I like Blazor:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Easy to Use:</strong> I can use C#, a language I'm comfortable with.</li>
                <li><strong>Reusable Components:</strong> I can make small parts of the website and use them again and again.</li>
                <li><strong>Fast Performance:</strong> Blazor runs fast using WebAssembly.</li>
                <li><strong>Lots of Tools:</strong> I can use many libraries and tools that come with .NET.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        <p>
            This website is my playground for learning Blazor. Here, I'm trying out different features and building small projects. It's like my online portfolio where I can showcase my skills.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Want to Learn</h2>
        <p>
            As I learn Blazor, here are some things I want to achieve:
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the basics of Blazor and how it works.</li>
                <li>Build interactive and dynamic web pages.</li>
                <li>Learn how to manage data and state in Blazor.</li>
                <li>Create a collection of projects to show my progress.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
