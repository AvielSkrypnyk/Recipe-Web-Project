## About
Welcome to my Blazor Learning Project! This project is created as part of my journey to learn Blazor, a powerful framework by Microsoft for building interactive web applications with C#.

## What is Blazor?
Blazor is a framework that enables developers to build web applications using C# instead of JavaScript. It allows both client-side and server-side development, running on WebAssembly for high performance.

## Project Purpose
This website serves as my playground for practicing Blazor. Here, I will try out different features and build small projects. It's like my online portfolio to showcase my skills as I progress with my learning.

## Features
- **Interactive Components**: Learn to build reusable and interactive components.
- **Form Handling**: Practice creating forms with validation in Blazor.
- **State Management**: Explore different ways to manage state in Blazor applications.
- **API Integration**: Learn how to fetch and submit data using HTTP APIs.

## Learning Goals
- Understand the basics of Blazor and its component model.
- Build interactive and dynamic web pages.
- Manage data and state within Blazor applications.
- Develop a portfolio of Blazor projects to demonstrate my skills.
